# Digital Drawing Tool
#### This project was assigned to me as a `Semester Final Project` in my `Object Orineted Programming` Course (2nd semster), by [Mr. Sarfraz Raza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarfraz-raza/).
This The task was to create MS-Paint clone using all OOP concepts we learned in our courses. This desktop application mimics the basic functionality of MS Paint, providing a canvas where users can draw and manipulate graphics.
